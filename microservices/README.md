## What is rearchitecting

The process of re-designing the architecture of an application based on more modern computing concepts.  Re-architecting is based on the knowledge that invaluable business logic and data relevant to the organization lies within the application code and surrounding artifacts (example, DDLs, copybooks, user training manuals) and that these assets should be leveraged in the new system.  Rearchitecting is not about rebuilding from scratch. One of the benefits of a modern IT environment is that a good deal of the business logic can reside above the code using declarative models and part of the original technical code can be replaced by middleware tools (BPM tools, business rule engines, data integration, access solutions) to achieve greater agility. So, rearchitecting focuses on capturing the value of the business process that is independent of the legacy code base, and moving it into a different paradigm while eliminating the technology-specific code. 
Rearchitecting can be confused with refactoring, which is simply the rewriting of parts of an application within the existing application architecture.
# Reasons to Re-Architect Applications for the Cloud

- Reduce Costs of Ownership. Large applications often cost too much when running on legacy hardware-based infrastructure, especially when the requirement to scale-out elasticity can be more easily provided by the cloud.
- Drive Agility. Traditional IT includes configuring servers, databases, and networking, all while ensuring end-to-end security. Developers typically have to wait for environments to be provisioned
- vAchieve Application Resilience. Monolithic applications are notorious when dealing with failures and issues – typically, any issue in any part of the application sets off a domino effect that takes down the entire app. Instead, fault tolerance can be built into each microservice.
- Enable Scalability.  Unable to scale on-premise instances fast enough, large technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon began migrating to the cloud over a decade ago and have since achieved true “web-scale” including elasticity and enormous horizontal resource scaling
- Do Not Compromise on Monitoring and Security. Monitoring and security are fundamentally different with cloud-native applications. Though monitoring and security are more complex and challenging for cloud-native applications, when done right they provide a level of visibility and confidence that is unheard of with traditional monolithic applications running on-premise.

# What other options are available?
What other options are available?
 
There are other Rs for migrating applications to the cloud, but the terms often used interchangeably can be confusing. Let’s clarify what the other Rs entail (and how they’re different from rearchitecting).
 
1- Reengineer: Rearchitect and reengineer application with new functionality and integrations.
2- Refactor: Sometimes called rearchitecting, this approach involves upgrading a current application to run better in a legacy environment.
3- Rehost: Sometimes called lift and shift, this approach involves moving an existing application from a legacy environment (such as an on-premises server) to newer infrastructure, such as a public Cloud platform with little to no changes to its underlying code or architecture.
4- Replace: Remove the original application completely and create a new one built for the Cloud environment.
5- Retire: Shut down existing code and commission and relinquish assets.
6- Retain: Keeping an application in its current form, which sometimes makes the most sense, such as with cloud-incompatible legacy operating systems or compliance standards that require on-site data or perform well in their current form.
7- Refresh: Upgrade path to new version release.
8- Reimagine: Legacy application is transformed to target technology.
9- Retool: Also called Conversion, this involves mapping an application transformation journey with one or more strategies.

# Recognizing the right time to rearchitect
If your company is transitioning from a traditional monolithic architecture or looking to enhance features, scalability and overall performance in ways not supported by the application’s current environment, rearchitecting is likely your best option.
Rearchitecting entails the most complex process with more steps than any other method. But the benefits (when executed successfully) easily justify the investment.

# Benefits of re-architecting applications for the cloud
. Supplementary business: Aligning the changes to business transformations provides clients to leverage the makeover to align with new business prospects and supplementary revenue streams.
. Reduced cost of ownership: Large applications run on legacy-based hardware infrastructure are expensive. Reducing large infrastructure costs is no small thing for companies considering rearchitecting applications for the cloud, where they can be more affordably operated and scaled.
. Increased agility and scalability: Cloud-native applications are highly adaptable by nature. When you migrate entire applications to the cloud, they automatically become more agile, thanks to microservices models that enable CI/CD pipelines and easily updated functionality to meet end-user needs.
. Better resilience: Monolithic applications are at risk of app-wide failure every time one component breaks. Cloud-native microservices isolate faults so that your applications are more resilient and can operate even as developers address bugs and other issues.
. Sophisticated security: It’s true that security can be complex for cloud-native applications, but when executed correctly, they also have important benefits such as better visibility and monitoring.

# Challenges to consider

Rearchitecting does have challenges that should be carefully considered:
- Cost: While it’s true that rearchitecting yields cost savings over time, the initial financial investment is substantial.
- Expertise and experience: Rearchitecting requires high-level DevOps skills and expert code knowledge. Developer teams not versed in cloud-native practices will encounter frustration and likely make missteps that could adversely affect the process. Companies without the internal experience and expertise to execute should consider hiring consultants who can help.
- Time: Rearchitecting is not an overnight process. Companies with urgent migration needs may want to consider using other “R” methods for time-sensitive migrations rather than rushing the rearchitecting process.
